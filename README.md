# QueryableConvolution
The code provided is an implementation of a potentially novel neural network architecture as a Keras layer in Tensorflow 2.0. The architecture is identical to that of a conventional convolutional layer except that an additional "query" vector is included in the transformation of each image patch in the convolution process. This implementation also adds composed hidden layers within a single queryable convolution layer.

# Applications
Applications for this architecture are numerous and broad. Here is a brief list of potential applications:
* Augmenting existing text-encoding representations with visual information instead of purely textual information
* High level scripted robotics
* Dynamic image-to-image mapping
* Dynamic object detection/recognition
* Interactive image captioning for the visually impaired
* New "question"-based attention model for image encoding in deep reinforcement learning

I believe this architecture offers a much richer approach to image processing than current architectures and could be widely adopted as a replacement for the "vanilla" convolutional layer.

# License
Note that I am not currently offering a license for this code. This is because I am highly interested in conducting more research into this idea myself and do not want others to take credit for it. My reason for making this code public is to demonstrate proof of work and to establish my contribution of this novel model in case others are also currently working on something similar. I plan to license this work after publishing a paper or if I feel that I simply cannot contribute adequately on the academic side.

# Contact
If you are interested in contacting me regarding this work, please feel free to do so at the email address provided in the code. I would very much like to hear your thoughts.
